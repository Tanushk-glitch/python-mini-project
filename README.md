# python-mini-project
📌 Project Description
This mini-project is a console-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using Python.
The objective of the project is to simulate a user vs computer game where the computer generates random choices and the winner is decided based on predefined game rules.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
python
Random module

🎲 Key Features & Functionality

Takes user input for Rock, Paper, or Scissors
Generates computer choice using the random module
Applies game logic using conditional statements
Displays round results (Win / Lose / Draw)
Option to play multiple rounds (if implemented)

🎯 Outcome
The project successfully simulates a real-time game experience in the terminal. It helps understand how logic-based programs work and demonstrates effective use of control flow and randomness in Python.
🚀 Learning Experience

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
Python basics and syntax
Conditional statements and loops
User input handling
Using the random module
